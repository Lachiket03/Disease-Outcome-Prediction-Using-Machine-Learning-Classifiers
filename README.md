# Disease-Outcome-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Classifiers

üìö **Overview**

This project explores the predictive performance of various machine learning classifiers for disease outcome prediction using symptom profiles and patient demographic data. The study compares four classifiers‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost‚Äîto identify the most effective model for this healthcare application.

üìÇ **Dataset Information**

The dataset used is the "Disease_symptom_and_patient_profile_dataset", which includes:

Symptoms: Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing

Demographics: Age, Gender

Health Indicators: Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level

Outcome Variable: Binary indicator (Positive/Negative) for disease presence

Note: The "Disease" column was removed during preprocessing as it wasn't required for the predictive modeling task.

üßπ **Data Preprocessing**

Removed Irrelevant Columns: Dropped the 'Disease' column.

Label Encoding: Applied label encoding to categorical variables.

Data Type Conversion: Converted the 'Age' column to integer type.

Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted using .info(), .describe(), and .columns, with visualizations for age distribution and gender frequency.

üîç Classifier Performance Comparison

| Classifier               | Accuracy Score | ROC AUC Score |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| Logistic Regression      | 52.6%          | 0.62          |
| Decision Tree            | 59.2%          | 0.59          |
| Random Forest Classifier | 57.9%          | 0.70          |
| AdaBoost Classifier      | 50.0%          | 0.60          |

Key Insight: The Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models with the highest ROC AUC score of 0.70, indicating superior discriminative ability.
